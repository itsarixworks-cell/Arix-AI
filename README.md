# Arix AI

Arix AI is a local, voice-first Windows desktop assistant. The current Phase 4 foundation combines a premium Electron interface and Python 3.11 Gemini Live bridge with typed function calling, two-tier long-term memory, an interactive 3D memory graph, verified executable side effects, and guarded webcam gesture control.

> Arix is intentionally a desktop application, not a hosted web application. The backend binds to `127.0.0.1`, and the Gemini API key stays on the user's machine.

## Completed features

- Electron desktop shell with a custom Windows title bar
- Responsive command-center interface built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- Animated audio orb, waveform, state colors, and live captions
- Real-time 16 kHz PCM microphone capture and native Gemini audio playback
- Input/output live transcription and secondary text input
- In-app Gemini API key, model, voice, and system-instruction fields
- Typed Gemini function registry with normalized success and error results
- `save_memory` and `request_memory` live-session tools
- 25 typed Gemini tools with normalized structured results, error codes, durations, and local JSONL audit records
- Memory: `save_memory` and `request_memory`
- Discovery: `open_app`, `web_search`, `weather_report`, `youtube_video`, and `flight_finder`
- Windows automation: `reminder`, `computer_settings`, `computer_control`, guarded `gesture_control`, and `shutdown_arix`
- Workspace automation: `browser_control`, `file_controller`, `desktop_control`, `screen_process`, and `file_processor`
- Webcam hand tracking maps the index fingertip to cursor movement and a debounced thumb-index pinch to click, with confirmation, bounded runtime, corner failsafe, and explicit stop/status actions
- File writes and Office/PDF builders use atomic publication, post-save existence/size verification, and OneDrive-aware known-folder aliases such as `Documents/Arix/report.docx`
- The live UI shows recent tool success/failure, saved paths, execution duration, and a user-operated confirmation retry button
- Browser form filling handles up to 20 reviewed fields without returning entered values, and folder organization supports file type or modified month
- Advanced processing includes Excel statistics, text-oriented PDF-to-Word conversion, and bounded FFmpeg stream-copy video trimming
- Integrations: reviewed message composers, private-LAN Kasa controls, and Steam update/install requests
- Builders: PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and PDF generation plus structured local agent-task records
- Allowlisted, shell-free application launching and HTTP(S)-only website opening
- Bounded web/network operations, optional-dependency loading, and explicit confirmations for consequential actions
- Tier-1 private text scratchpad injected into each session
- Durable graph memory with atomic local JSON storage or optional Firebase RTDB
- Gemini 2.5 Flash memory extraction, fuzzy retrieval, and conservative maintenance
- Best-effort background ingestion of completed turns without blocking conversation
- Interactive, searchable 3D memory constellation with category and importance filters
- Live memory updates over a local WebSocket and a REST snapshot endpoint
- Legacy memory migration and Firebase upload utilities

## Technology

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop | Electron 43 |
| Interface | React 18, TypeScript, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS 3 |
| Backend | Python 3.11, FastAPI, Uvicorn |
| AI | `google-genai` 1.75, Gemini Live API, Gemini 2.5 Flash memory manager |
| Memory | Atomic local JSON/text fallback or Firebase Realtime Database |
| Visualization | Three.js and `3d-force-graph` (lazy-loaded) |
| Transport | Local WebSockets at `/ws/live` and `/ws/memory` |
| Audio input | Mono PCM16, 16 kHz, little-endian |

Python **3.11** is the supported runtime. Dependency versions are pinned in `backend/requirements.txt` for repeatable Windows installation. Newer Python runtimes are not used because ecosystem compatibility is narrower for the planned Windows automation and audio stack.

## Architecture

```text
Microphone / text
       │
       ▼
Electron renderer (React)
  ├─ audio resampling + playback
  ├─ live transcript and session state
  └─ lazy-loaded 3D memory workspace
       │ local REST + WebSockets
       ▼
Python FastAPI bridge
  ├─ Gemini Live lifecycle and event translation
  ├─ bounded real-time audio queue
  ├─ typed 25-tool registry with confirmation, audit, and path guards
  └─ two-tier memory runtime
       ├─ private text scratchpad
       ├─ local graph JSON or Firebase RTDB
       └─ Gemini 2.5 Flash memory manager
       │ secure Gemini connections
       ▼
Gemini 3.1 Flash Live Preview + Gemini 2.5 Flash
```

The renderer never contacts Gemini or Firebase directly. This isolates credentials and establishes a boundary for tool execution, authorization, persistence, and future Windows automation.

## Windows setup

### Prerequisites

1. Windows 10 or 11
2. [Python 3.11 (64-bit)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with the Python launcher enabled
3. [Node.js 20 LTS or newer](https://nodejs.org/)
4. A Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
5. Optional: the Tesseract desktop binary for OCR actions
6. Optional: FFmpeg on `PATH` for video trimming
7. A webcam and Windows camera permission for gesture control

### Install

Clone the repository, open PowerShell in the repository, and run:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-windows.ps1
```

Or use Command Prompt:

```bat
scripts\setup-windows.bat
```

### Start

```powershell
.\scripts\start-windows.ps1
```

The setup scripts also install Playwright's isolated Chromium browser. The start command launches the local Python bridge, Vite, and Electron together. Keep the terminal open while using this development build.

## User guide

1. Launch Arix.
2. Select **Configure** or the Settings icon.
3. Paste your Gemini API key into the in-app field.
4. Keep the default live model unless Google changes the preview model available to your account.
5. Choose a voice and optionally edit the system instruction.
6. Select **Start live session** and allow microphone access.
7. Speak naturally. The orb and waveform respond to microphone activity, and Arix plays audio as it arrives.
8. Use the right-side composer to send text in the same session.
9. Open **Memory** from the navigation rail to inspect the constellation. Search titles, filter categories, adjust minimum importance, inspect nodes, or fit the graph to the viewport.
10. Review executable actions in the right-side **Recent actions** feed. Saved paths and failures appear there; use **Confirm** only after reviewing a consequential request.
11. To use hand tracking, ask Arix to start gesture control and confirm. Move your index fingertip to move the cursor, pinch thumb and index finger once to click, and move the pointer to a screen corner or ask Arix to stop.
12. Select **End live session** when finished.

The API key is deliberately not stored. Enter it again after restarting the application. When Firebase is not configured, memory remains local under `backend/data/` (or `ARIX_DATA_DIR`).

## Local endpoints and protocol

- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8765/health` — backend health information
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/memory/snapshot` — active graph snapshot
- `WS ws://127.0.0.1:8765/ws/live` — live bidirectional session
- `WS ws://127.0.0.1:8765/ws/memory` — changed graph snapshots

First live WebSocket message:

```json
{
  "type": "session.start",
  "apiKey": "...",
  "model": "gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview",
  "voice": "Kore",
  "systemInstruction": "You are Arix..."
}
```

Subsequent binary frames are raw PCM16 microphone chunks. Text frames use `{ "type": "text", "text": "..." }`. Server events include `session.ready`, `status`, `transcript`, `audio`, `tool.result`, `turn.complete`, `interrupted`, and `error`.

### Optional Firebase memory

Leave Firebase variables unset to use local memory. To use Firebase RTDB, copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`, set `ARIX_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL`, and provide either `ARIX_FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (a path outside the repository) or `ARIX_FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`. Never commit credentials.

## Development commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Backend + Vite + Electron
npm run build      # TypeScript and production renderer build
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript validation
npm run test       # Python tests and frontend lint
```

Backend only:

```bash
python -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --reload
```

## Data architecture

- `tier1_memory.txt`: bounded private scratchpad for explicit durable facts
- `memory_graph.json`: local adjacency-list graph fallback
- `tool_audit.jsonl`: local execution metadata containing timestamps, tool names, argument keys, result status/error code, and duration; argument values are never recorded
- Firebase `/memory/nodes`: full memory nodes
- Firebase `/memory/edges`: bidirectional adjacency data
- Firebase `/memory/title_index`: compact retrieval index
- Firebase `/memory/anchors`: permanent Arix and user root markers

Persistent memory, text replacements, processed outputs, and generated Office/PDF files use a temporary sibling followed by an atomic replace and verification. Graph nodes support categories, importance, access metadata, source attribution, archiving, and weighted relationships.

## Security notes

- The backend listens only on the loopback interface by default.
- WebSocket browser origins are restricted to local development origins and Electron's local file origin.
- The API key is excluded from logs and is never written by the app.
- Firebase credentials remain backend-only.
- Electron uses context isolation, sandboxing, and no Node.js integration in the renderer.
- `.env` files, generated builds, Python caches, and local secrets are ignored by Git.
- Application launching is restricted to an explicit allowlist and never invokes a command shell.
- Website opening accepts only HTTP(S) URLs; search, weather, image, and metadata calls use bounded requests.
- File operations resolve paths beneath the user profile, reject traversal/symlink escapes, bound reads and traversal, and use the Recycle Bin for deletion.
- Shutdown, delete, overwrite, move, organization, message composition, browser submissions, smart-home state changes, and Steam installs/updates require explicit confirmation.
- Browser automation uses one isolated Playwright context, blocks local/internal URL targets, applies timeouts, and does not log typed values.
- Optional Windows, gesture, browser, media, and document dependencies are loaded only when their tool is called, with actionable install errors.
- Webcam pointer control requires explicit confirmation, has a maximum runtime, uses PyAutoGUI's corner failsafe, and never records or stores camera frames.
- File creation, replacement, processed outputs, and Office/PDF builders publish through temporary sibling files and verify the final file before reporting success.
- Tool audit records contain argument names only, never message text, typed form values, file content, or other argument values.
- No executable tool evaluates generated code or accepts arbitrary shell commands.

## Testing status

- Frontend production build: passing
- TypeScript type-check: passing
- ESLint: passing
- Python unit/API tests: passing (56 tests)
- Backend Python compile check: passing
- Memory, registry, audit, atomic-save, known-folder, confirmation, file, browser, gesture, computer, integration, processor, document, and API tests: passing
- Live Gemini and Firebase credentials require manual verification on Windows with valid account access, network access, and microphone permission

## Not implemented yet

- Full conversation history and session resumption (durable fact memory is implemented)
- Production installer containing an embedded Python runtime and OCR binary
- Secure persisted API-key storage
- Persistent audit-history browser and granular per-tool permission settings (the current live session shows recent action results and confirmation prompts)
- Direct provider APIs that can prove message delivery; current messaging opens a reviewed composer and correctly reports `sent: false`
- Autonomous arbitrary-code execution; `agent_task` intentionally stores and tracks structured tasks only
- Audio/video transcription, layout-preserving PDF/Word editing, rich PowerPoint themes, and Excel chart generation
- Provider-authenticated Atomberg routines, Epic scheduling/monitoring, Instagram posting/DMs, and delivery-verifiable WhatsApp/Telegram sends
- Parsed Google Flights summaries, YouTube summarization, and YouTube trending retrieval

## Recommended next steps

1. Run Windows hardware integration tests for webcam tracking, brightness, multi-monitor capture, Task Scheduler, Steam, FFmpeg, Playwright, and Kasa devices.
2. Add Windows Credential Manager integration for optional key persistence.
3. Bundle a managed Python 3.11 runtime, Playwright Chromium, optional OCR runtime, and FFmpeg into the Electron installer.
4. Add SQLite conversation history, persistent audit browsing, and session resumption.
5. Add granular per-session consent controls for screen capture, OCR, keyboard, mouse, and camera automation.
6. Add provider-authenticated Atomberg, Epic Games, Instagram, and delivery-verifiable messaging integrations without storing credentials in the renderer.
7. Add media transcription and YouTube/flight summarization through the active backend Gemini session.
8. Create a signed Windows installer through a Windows GitHub Actions runner.
